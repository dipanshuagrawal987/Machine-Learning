# Curse Of Dimensionality (COD)
### COD includes removal of the excess features from the dataset such that the accuracy of the ML model does not decrease, rather it becomes computationaly easier for the machine to process the data.
### The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience.
